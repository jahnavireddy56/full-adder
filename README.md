# Full Adder ðŸ”¢

A **Full Adder** is a fundamental combinational circuit in digital electronics that performs the addition of three binary inputs:

* Two significant bits (**A** and **B**)
* One carry-in bit (**Cin**)

It produces two outputs:

* **Sum (S)** â†’ Represents the binary addition result.
* **Carry-out (Cout)** â†’ Represents the carry generated from the addition.

## Logic Equations âœ¨

* **Sum (S) = A âŠ• B âŠ• Cin**
* **Carry-out (Cout) = (A Â· B) + (Cin Â· (A âŠ• B))**

## Block Diagram ðŸ§©

A Full Adder can be built using **two Half Adders** and an **OR gate**:

* First Half Adder â†’ Adds **A** and **B**.
* Second Half Adder â†’ Adds output of first HA with **Cin**.
* OR gate â†’ Generates final **Cout**.
